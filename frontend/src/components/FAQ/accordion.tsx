            However library full of books might make your apartment really cosy
            that is all there is in it for you. Some of the books are a one time
            read, so why don't you get some additional value out of them by
            passing them to someone else while receiving funds for further
            reading. Check out what{" "}

            As we mentioned in above question we take 0% commissions on all the
            sales. Meaning you don't share the money you get from the sales with
            us. How does this project make money then? It doesn't and that is
            okay. Developers are billionaires who don't care about money
